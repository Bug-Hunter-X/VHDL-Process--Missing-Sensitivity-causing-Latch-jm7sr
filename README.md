This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in VHDL code: a latch created by an incomplete sensitivity list in a process.  The provided `bug.vhdl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.vhdl` provides the corrected version.  The error is explained in detail below. 

**Problem:**
In VHDL processes, the `if` statement within the `process` is only executed when a signal listed in the sensitivity list changes its value.  Failure to include all signals that are read *and* potentially influence the output can lead to unexpected behavior - in this case, an unintended latch.

**Solution:**
The solution includes all necessary signals in the sensitivity list, which ensures that the process reacts to changes in every signal that might affect the `data_out` signal. This eliminates the unexpected behavior and ensures the code functions as intended. This is crucial for synthesizability and predictable behavior.

This example highlights the importance of carefully considering signal dependencies when designing VHDL processes to avoid subtle bugs and ensure correct functionality.
